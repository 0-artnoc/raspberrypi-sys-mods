raspberrypi-sys-mods (20160321) jessie; urgency=medium

  * This update replaces ttyAMA0 and ttyS0 with serial0 and serial1 in /boot/cmdline.txt
  * On the Raspberry Pi 3, ttyAMA0 is used to communicate with Bluetooth chip.
    In order to support using the same SD card across all models of the Raspberry Pi, some changes have been made:
    - Device tree aliases have been added for the 'free'/console and bluetooth serial devices (serial0 and serial1, respecitvely)
    - The firmare reads cmdline.txt and replaces instances of serial0 and serial1 accordingly
    - When running on a Pi 3, the firmware replaces ttyAMA0 with ttyS0 in cmdline.txt. This may be removed in the future.
    - A udev rules has been added to 99-com.rules which creates /dev/serial0 and /dev/serial1 symlinks
    If you have any custom changes relating to serial, it is worth rebooting and checking that /proc/cmdline contains what you expect
  * Raspberry Pi 3 serial console does not use correct baudrate
    See https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/553 and https://github.com/RPi-Distro/repo/issues/22
    - Current workarounds are adding force_turbo=1, gpu_freq=300, or core_freq=250 to /boot/config.txt
